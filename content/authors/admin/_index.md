I am a Research Engineer in the Fermat laboratory of the R&D department at HUAWEI Technologies (Grenoble, France), with expertise in requirements engineering, model-based design, development, verification, and validation of complex software-intensive systems, and building model simulators and code generators. I hold a Ph.D. in Software Engineering focused on testing frameworks for domain-specific languages[(link to thesis)](https://theses.hal.science/tel-03977604/). I have a proven track record of translating advanced research into scalable engineering solutions and collaborating with international, cross-functional teams to deliver robust, high-quality products. I have recently begun investigating state-of-the-art approaches for verifying the factuality of LLM–generated responses, with the aim of improving the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-assisted systems.
